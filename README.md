# LEMONSolver

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project implements `MCFLEMONSolver`, a SMS++ :Solver
for [MCFBlock](https://gitlab.com/smspp/mcfblock) based
on interfacing solvers from the
[LEMON PROJECT](https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon).
In fact, `MCFLEMONSolver` is not a single solver but no less
than 16 classes obtained instantiating 4 different "base"
solvers

Each solver is instantiated on two different types of graphs (SmartDigraph and MCFListDigraph) and on the types of costs and capacities on the edges, which can be Double or Long. Although int is supported, for very large graphs it risks overflowing the size of an int.

The algorithms implemented by the LEMON project are:

- NetworkSimplex
- CostScaling
- CycleCanceling
- CapacityScaling

For each of these algorithms, a class has been created, derived from a base class MCFLemonSolver that unites them, to manage method calls correctly using polymorphism.

The interface with the solvers provided by the LEMON project works thanks to the modifications made to the include/lemon/array_map.h file. Since it has not been updated for some time, it was not compatible with C++20 versions, causing problems, especially with the compilation of Concepts. This file is provided within the include/lemon directory, modified to ensure correctness, and a patch has been proposed to the LEMON developers, who I assume will modify this file to make it available in their repositories.

The files are provided "working," so the user does not need to download LEMON themselves. If they did, the array_map.h file downloaded from LEMON might not have been updated yet, potentially compromising the compilation of MCFLemonSolver.

If LEMON provides a new release and the user wants to update, it is necessary to check the correctness of array_map.h, particularly the correct use of std::allocator.

This repository depends, of course, on MCFBlock, as its proper functioning depends on it. The reasons why MCFLemonSolver strictly depends on MCFBlock are:

- All LEMON structures contained within MCFLemonSolver depend on the relative structures of MCFBlock (the cost map of LEMON depends on the cost vector of MCFBlock, and so on ...)

- For the Modifications, an instance of MCFBlock is modified to reflect its changes to the LEMON structures contained in MCFLemonSolver.

Currently, LEMON provides solvers that are compatible with integer costs and capacities, so tests with double values for these would not work.


## Getting started

These instructions will let you build MCFBlock and MCFLemonSolver on your system.

### Requirements

- The [SMS++ core library](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp) and
  its requirements

- [MCFBlock](https://gitlab.com/smspp/mcfblock) and its
  requirements (but no actual `MCFSolver` are needed, since
  `LEMONSolver` provides its own)

<<<<<<< HEAD
- The [LEMON PROJECT](https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon), currently contained
  in this repository, do not download the LEMON Project from their site if there
  aren't new realeses, for the reasons discussed above, but use what is provided
  as "functional" in this repository.

### INSTALL
Run install.sh script for install the umbrella project

>>>>>>> 3587a0f95544d63e767d768c535e345b48386907
### Build and install with CMake

First you have to separately build LEMON with

```sh
cd lemon-development
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../lib
make
make install
cd ..
rm -Rf build
```

This will build a LEMON instance in
lemon-development/lib (getting rid of the build folder).

Then configure and build the library with:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../lib
make
```

The library has the same configuration options of
[SMS++](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project/-/wikis/Customize-the-configuration).

Optionally, install the library in the system with:

```sh
sudo make install
```


### Usage with CMake

After the library is built, you can use it in your CMake project with:

```cmake
find_package(MCFBlock)
target_link_libraries(<my_target> SMS++::MCFBlock)
```


### Running the tests with CMake

A unit test will be built with the library.
To disable it, set the option `BUILD_TESTING` to `OFF`.

The test takes an instance of a MCF in DIMACS or NC4 format. The MCF problem
is then repeatedly solved with several changes in costs/capacities/deficits,
arcs openings/closures and arcs additions/deletions. The same operations are
performed on the two solvers, and the results are compared.


### Build and install with makefiles

Carefully hand-crafted makefiles have also been developed for those unwilling
to use CMake. Makefiles build the executable in-source (in the same directory
tree where the code is) as opposed to out-of-source (in the copy of the
directory tree constructed in the build/ folder) and therefore it is more
convenient when having to recompile often, such as when developing/debugging
a new module, as opposed to the compile-and-forget usage envisioned by CMake.

Each executable using `MCFBlock` has to include a "main makefile" of the
module, which typically is either [makefile-c](makefile-c) including all
necessary libraries comprised the "core SMS++" one, or
[makefile-s](makefile-s) including all necessary libraries but not the "core
SMS++" one (for the common case in which this is used together with other
modules that already include them). One relevant case is the
[tester comparing MCFBlock + MCFSolver with direct usage of the
original :MCFClass solver](test/test.cpp) alluded to in the previous section.
The makefiles in turn recursively include all the required other makefiles,
hence one should only need to edit the "main makefile" for compilation type
(C++ compiler and its options) and it all should be good to go. In case some
of the external libraries are not at their default location, it should only be
necessary to create the `../extlib/makefile-paths` out of the
`extlib/makefile-default-paths-*` for your OS `*` and edit the relevant bits
(commenting out all the rest).

Check the [SMS++ installation wiki](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project/-/wikis/Customize-the-configuration#location-of-required-libraries)
for further details.

Note thar the [MCFClass
project](https://github.com/frangio68/Min-Cost-Flow-Class) has a similar
arrangement with its own extlib/ folder, but due to some magic it is noy
necessary to that must be independently edit it in an analogous way.


## Tools

We provide a simple tool that converts MCF instances written in the DIMACS
standard into netCDF files. Optionally it hacks into the netCDF file to
change the number of static and dynamic nodes and arcs, as well as the
maximum number of nodes and arcs.

You can run the tool from the `<build-dir>/tools` directory or install it
with the library (see above). Run the tool without arguments for info on
its usage:

```sh
dmx2nc4
```


## Data

We provide a small sample of small-to-mid-size MCF problems in the
[data](data) folder. The instances comes compressed in the `dmx.tgz` file
in [data/dmx](data/dmx). Once this is decompressed and `data/nc4` is
created, the netCDF versions of the instances can be created in there by
running the `batch` file in the `tools` folder.


## Tests

The [test](test) folder contains a tester that reads an instance of a MCF
from a file (in either DIMACS or netCDF format) in an `MCFBlock`, and from
there in an object of a class MCFC derived from `MCFClass`, as decided by
the macro `WHICH_MCF`. Then, a `MCFSolver< MCFC >` is attached to the
`MCFBlock`. The MCF problem is then repeatedly solved with several changes in
costs / capacities / deficits, arcs openings / closures and arcs additions /
deletions. The same operations are performed on the two solvers, and the
results are compared. This mostly tests `MCFBlock` and `MCFSolver`, since
the actual `MCFClass` solved is the same, and so it can easily be wrong in
the same way for both the objects. The `batch` file tests basically only one
instance but in many different configurations (there can actually be two
`MCFBlock`, one of which is modified and the other solved, in all possible
combinations) and repeatedly, while the `batch-l` tests only the simplest
case but on several different problems of the [data](data) folder.
