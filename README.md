Thesis's project for bachelor's degree at University of Pisa

A C++ interface between SMS++ library and Lemon library for solving
block-structured MinCostFlow problems.

Lemon-development contains a copy of the development branch made on 07/29/2020 by Lemon and since there is no git repository, version control has to be done by hand, in case there is a newer version.
